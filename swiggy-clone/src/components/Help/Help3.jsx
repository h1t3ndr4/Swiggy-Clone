              We value our customerâ€™s time and hence moved away from a single
              customer care number to a comprehensive chat-based support system
              for quick and easy resolution. You no longer have to go through
              the maze of an IVRS call support. Just search for your issue in
              the help section on this page and initiate a chat with us. A
              customer care executive will be assigned to you shortly. You can
              also email us your issue on support@swiggy.in Note: We value your
              privacy and your information is safe with us. Please do not reveal
              any personal information, bank account number, OTP etc. to another
              person. A Swiggy representative will never ask you for these
              details. Please do not reveal these details to fraudsters and
              imposters claiming to be calling on our behalf. Be vigilant and do
              not entertain phishing calls or emails.
